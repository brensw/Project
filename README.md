# Programming and Scripting Project 


## Dataset Used
The dataset used in this project is Fischerâ€™s Iris data set. The data is taken from a 1936 paper by Ronald Fischer. The dataset conatains fifty instances of sepal length and width along with the petal length and width of three species of the Iris flowers, these being the Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor(UCI, n.d). 

The relatively small size and completeness of the the dataset means that it is ideal as test dataset when developing programs/methods for machine learning and data analysis. As a result Fischer's Iris data set has become very well known and is commonly used to check if a new method is behaving as expected etc.

## The Code and Analysis

The analysis of the dataset is carried out with the use of various Python libaries, the libaries required are imported in the first portion of code. The libaries used are:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn 

Once these libraries are imported, the dataset is loaded directly from the UCI archive URL, loading the dataset directly from the URL allows the code to be run on any machine with an internet connection, however, if any modification to the dataset was expected then loading from a locally stored copy of the dataset would be preferable to ensure that any changes made previouly would be accessable. 

The version of Fischer's dataset used is in the CSV format, the Pandas library CSV tools are used to handle this file. The columns are given appropriate names and a dataframe created, again utilizing Pandas, to allow for easier analysis later. 

With the dataset loaded and formatted, the program creates a onscreen menu for the user giving  the user six options:

1. Display the data 
2. Display a summary of the data 
3. Create and show a scatter matrix of sepal vs petal length
4. Create and show a scatter matrix of of all varibles 
5. Display a graph displaying the realtive importance of each varible in determing the species of Iris
6. Exit the program.

The menu is intedned to reappear after a selected option other then Exit, has been carried out to allow the user to perform as many operations as desisred until they exit the program. The menu itself is created using an 'if' loop, the user enters values from 1 to 6 causing the appropriate code to run, values higher then 6 causes an new message to enter a number between 1 and 6  to be displayed to the user. 

### Option 1
If option one is selected then the Pandas dataframe created earlier is displayed to the user. The code 'print(df)' was used to display the data as it allowed for the titled data to shown using very simple code.

### Option 2
If option two is selected, then Pandas DataFrame.describe funtion is called. This function generates a basic analysis of the dataset. The information generated by default include:

* Count for number of instaces in each colunm
* Mean for each colunm
* The Standard Deviation for each colunm
* The Minimum value found in each colunm
* The 25th, 50th and 75th percintiles   
* The Maximum value for each column 

This method was chosen as it generates alot of useful information very easily.While the information generated here is very useful, it is not broken down by specices as a result it is limited. The graphic representation of data is often preferred over data in a table type format as it can be easier to assess the realtionship between varibles when dispalyed graphiclly. With that in mind we move on to the next option

### Option 3 

If the user selects option three then a scatter plot of petal lenght versus sepal length is created and displayed for each species. The plot is created using the Pandas library with the describe.species being used to break the data into three seperate species, each being assigned a colour. The resulting images is displayed using the Matplotlib library. 

This scatter plot shows the realtive size difference of each species in realtion to each other, along with the realtionship between sepal and petal lenghts for each species. One can see on the image below that Iris Setosa is significanly smaller then the other two species. Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor have somew overlap, although Virginica is generally seen to be larger then Iris Versicolor.
